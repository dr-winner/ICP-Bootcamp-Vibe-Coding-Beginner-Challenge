# Module 7: ICP Integration

## Core Module

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and its architecture
- Learn how to develop canister smart contracts using Rust
- Master the integration of Rust with the Internet Computer
- Build and deploy decentralized applications on the Internet Computer

## Content Summary

This module introduces you to developing for the Internet Computer Protocol using Rust. You'll learn how the Internet Computer works, how to write canister smart contracts in Rust, and how to deploy your applications to the ICP network.

## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to the Internet Computer

   - Understanding the Internet Computer architecture
   - Canisters and the actor model
   - Orthogonal persistence
   - Cycles and resource management

2. Rust for Internet Computer Development

   - The `ic-cdk` and related libraries
   - Actor model implementation in Rust
   - Asynchronous programming in canisters
   - Thread local storage and state management

3. Building Smart Contracts

   - Defining canister interfaces
   - Implementing query and update methods
   - Inter-canister calls
   - Working with stable memory

4. Deployment and Testing
   - Local development with DFINITY SDK
   - Testing canister smart contracts
   - Deploying to the IC network
   - Interacting with deployed canisters

## Exercises

In the [exercises](./exercises/) directory, you'll find practice problems to reinforce these concepts:

1. **Hello ICP** - Create and deploy a simple greeting canister
2. **State Management** - Build a canister that maintains state across upgrades
3. **Multi-Canister App** - Develop a simple application using multiple communicating canisters
