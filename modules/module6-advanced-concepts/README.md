# Module 6: Advanced Concepts

## Optional Module

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement traits in Rust
- Master Rust's error handling mechanisms
- Learn how to write and run tests in Rust
- Build command-line applications with Rust

## Content Summary

This module covers advanced Rust concepts including traits, error handling, testing, and CLI development. These topics will help you write more sophisticated, robust, and user-friendly Rust applications.

## Topics Covered

1. Traits

   - Defining and implementing traits
   - Default implementations
   - Trait bounds and trait objects
   - The most common standard library traits

2. Error Handling

   - The `panic!` macro and when to use it
   - Recoverable errors with `Result<T, E>`
   - Propagating errors with the `?` operator
   - Creating custom error types

3. Testing

   - Writing unit tests
   - Test organization and conventions
   - Using assertions
   - Integration tests

4. CLI Applications
   - Parsing command-line arguments
   - Using CLI libraries like `clap` or `structopt`
   - Reading from and writing to the terminal
   - Exit codes and error reporting

## Exercises
